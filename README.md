<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great Boilerplate nestJs for Restful API available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Boilerplate nestJs that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

  [ ] Best Practice for NodeJs

  [ ] Support for Multi language

  [x] MongoDB as The Database

  [x] Handle Errors Centrally and Easily for Maintenance Our Error Code 

  [x] Config in File *.env*

  [x] Pagination on Server Side

  [x] JWT as Authorization

  [x] HmacSHA512 as Password Encryption

  [ ] Better Logger with Winston

  [ ] Request Validation

  [ ] Docker

  [ ] CI/CD Jenkins

  [x] EsLint as Linter

  [ ] Blacklist JWT Token

  [ ] User have They Settings on Database

  [ ] Master Setting for Our Project on Database

  [ ] Database Migration for Init Project

  [x] CRUD Example

Of course, no one boilerplate will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
